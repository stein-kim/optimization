Optimization model for Amazon distribution problem

This project was completed during my MS Data Analytics - Data Science program at WGU. 

The premise of the project is as follows:
Amazon.com is a major online retailer and has transitioned in recent years to a logistics company even more than a retail giant. Amazon Air began operations in 2015 with 20 leased aircraft and in 2018 leased an additional 10 aircraft for a total of 30. By 2020, Amazon Air had leased a total of 50 aircraft. At present, Amazon Air has a main cargo hub at Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport and a regional air hub at Fort Worth Alliance Airport.
From these two hubs, aircraft deliver packages to fulfillment centers located outside of their local line-haul network. There are 68 such centers, of which 3 are called focus cities. All the centers that are not focus cities (65) may receive cargo directly from one of the hubs or the focus cities.
Each center city has a total cargo demand to satisfy Amazon customers in those cities. Those are found below in Table 1. The hubs and focus cities also have capacity limits to the total amount of cargo that can be shipped through them every month. Those are also shown in Table 1 (I converted the tables into CSV files for ease of use).
The distribution costs between each focus and center city are known and are shown in Table 2.
